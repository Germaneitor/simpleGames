## Python Games

This repository contains simple games done using Python, some of them use different libraries, others don't. I am using this to practice Python as a language and see what I can do with different libraries; I got through tutorials to get a general idea of the tools, so some of these might be just going through said tutorial to create that game. The idea is to maybe create a game using what I learn; I may leave this dry for a long time but I hope to come to back often to work on something. If it's not this, then it may be something with my inputs repo.
Also, both of them are allowing to get more used to using git to do work.
